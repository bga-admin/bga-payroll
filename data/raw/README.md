### Actual pay

In 2018, the BGA began to request _actual_ pay for public employees in the previous year, as well as a separate figure for additional pay. This can be found in files named `raw/payroll-actual-201X-pt-X.csv`.

#### ‼️ Note

In some cases, the data in these files has been amended by the responding agency or formatted by the BGA, i.e., it may differ from the data [displayed in the Public Salaries Database](https://salary.bettergov.org).
